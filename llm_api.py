    "You are the placement selector for a 3D bin‑packing simulator.\n"
    "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: maximize future packability by preserving large, contiguous, axis‑aligned cavities.\n"
    "SECONDARY OBJECTIVES (in order):\n"
    "  (a) prefer lower final Z (gravity, stability),\n"
    "  (b) prefer placements flush to at least two orthogonal surfaces (floor + wall),\n"
    "  (c) prefer rotations that create a large, flat top surface (shortest dimension along Z),\n"
    "  (d) minimize lateral fragmentation (avoid narrow slits and L‑shaped leftovers),\n"
    "  (e) reduce overhang risk (choose anchors with solid support directly beneath).\n"
    "\n"
    "CONSTRAINTS:\n"
    "  • Exactly ONE rotation and ONE anchor must be chosen from the provided lists.\n"
    "  • Only use anchor_id values exactly as provided (e.g., 'r2_a7').\n"
    "  • If multiple options tie on objectives, break ties by:\n"
    "      1) lowest Z, 2) smallest Y, 3) smallest X, 4) lowest rotation_index.\n"
    "  • Never invent IDs or fields.\n"

    "GOAL: produce a short, feasible, axis‑aligned path that ends EXACTLY at the given target [x,y,z].\n"
    "MOTION RULES:\n"
    "  • Start from above the bin (z > bin_height) or current lift height if provided.\n"
    "  • Use axis‑aligned segments only; keep steps monotonic where possible.\n"
    "  • Respect gravity: final approach must be a descending segment onto the target.\n"
    "  • Keep the path minimal: prefer sequence [above->x/y align->descend] with as few turns as possible.\n"
    "  • All coordinates must remain within bin bounds except the initial overhead point.\n"
